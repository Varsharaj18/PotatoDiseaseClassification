This project is a Potato Disease Detection Model that implement deep learning techniques to identify early and late blight in potato plants. By enabling farmers to detect diseases at an early stage and apply appropriate treatments, the model helps minimize crop waste and prevent economic losses. It serves as a valuable tool for farmers and agricultural researchers to enhance disease management and improve potato yield.Model Building: tensorflow, CNN, data augmentation, tf dataset. Model Optimization: Quantization, Tensorflow lite
